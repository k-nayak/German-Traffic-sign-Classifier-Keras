# German-Traffic-sign-Classifier-Keras
In this project, I used Python and Keras to classify traffic signs. Dataset used: German Traffic Sign Dataset. This dataset has more than 56,249 images of 43 classes. The model is based on LeNet architecture which has achieved Train_accuracy : 97.3% , Validation_accuracy : 99.2%, Test_accuracy : 96.5%
